## ‚ú® Features

### üéØ **Smart User Agent Management**

Real-time user agent spoofing with intelligent device and browser matching for realistic user agents. Automatic user agent rotation with customizable intervals and one-click random user agent selection.

**How it works**: The extension intercepts HTTP requests and replaces the User-Agent header with your selected value. It also updates browser properties to maintain consistency across all fingerprinting methods.

### üé≤ **Smart Random Selection**

Advanced filtering system that lets you select user agents based on specific criteria. Filter by device type (Android, iPhone, iPad, Linux, Mac, Windows), browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Safari, Vivaldi), or source (Latest, Most Common, Custom, All).

**How it works**: Choose your preferred device and browser, then click "Smart Random" to get a matching user agent. The system filters through thousands of real user agents to find the perfect match for your criteria.

### ‚è∞ **Auto-Random with Intervals**

Automated user agent rotation that changes your browser identity at specified intervals (1-60 minutes). Works in the background without requiring popup interaction and respects your current device/browser preferences.

**How it works**: Enable the auto-random toggle, set your desired interval, and the extension will automatically change user agents in the background. Perfect for maintaining privacy during long browsing sessions.

### üéõÔ∏è **Advanced Site Filtering**

Three modes of operation for targeted privacy protection. Global Mode applies to all websites, Whitelist Mode applies only to selected sites, and Blacklist Mode applies to all sites except selected ones.

**How it works**:

- **Global Mode**: Maximum privacy protection for all websites
- **Whitelist Mode**: Add specific domains to apply user agent spoofing only to those sites
- **Blacklist Mode**: Add specific domains to exclude them from user agent spoofing

### üõ†Ô∏è **Custom User Agents**

Add and manage your own user agent strings with persistent storage. Custom user agents integrate seamlessly with all other features including smart random selection.

**How it works**: Enter any user agent string in the custom input field and save it. Your custom user agents are stored locally and can be used with random selection, auto-random, and all filtering features.

### üìä **Visual Status Indicators**

Real-time badge indicators on the extension icon show current status with color-coded feedback. Red for disabled, green for all sites, blue for whitelist, and purple for blacklist mode.

**How it works**: The badge updates instantly when you change settings, providing immediate visual feedback about your current privacy protection status.

### üöÄ **Performance & Caching**

24-hour caching of user agent lists with automatic updates and manual refresh options. Optimized data structures ensure fast response times for all operations.

**How it works**: User agent data is cached locally for 24 hours to reduce network requests and improve performance. The cache automatically refreshes when needed, or you can manually refresh for the latest data.
