## ‚ùì FAQ

### **Is this extension safe to use?**
Yes! The extension only changes your browser's user agent string and doesn't collect any personal data. All settings are stored locally on your device.

### **Will this break websites?**
Most websites work perfectly with changed user agents. Some sites might show different layouts (mobile vs desktop), but functionality remains the same.

### **Can websites still track me?**
This extension helps protect against browser fingerprinting, but other tracking methods (cookies, IP address, etc.) may still work. For complete privacy, combine with other privacy tools.

### **Why do I need to reload the extension?**
The extension loads user agent data from the internet. If you're offline or the data source is unavailable, the extension will use built-in fallback user agents.

### **Can I use this with other privacy extensions?**
Yes! This extension works well with other privacy tools like uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, and others.

### **Will this affect my browsing speed?**
No noticeable impact on speed. The extension uses efficient caching and minimal resources.
